  abstract = {Many studies have shown that it is possible to recognize people by
	the way they walk. However, there are a number of covariate factors
	that affect recognition performance. The time between capturing the
	gallery and the probe has been reported to affect recognition the
	most. To date, no study has shown the isolated effect of time, irrespective
	of other covariates. Here we present the first principled study that
	examines the effect of elapsed time on gait recognition. Using empirical
	evidence we show for the first time that elapsed time does not affect
	recognition significantly in the short to medium term. By controlling
	the clothing worn by the subjects and the environment, a Correct
	Classification Rate (CCR) of 95\% has been achieved over 9 months,
	on a dataset of 2280 gait samples. Our results show that gait can
	be used as a reliable biometric over time and at a distance. We have
	created a new multimodal temporal database to enable the research
	community to investigate various gait and face covariates. We have
	also investigated the effect of different type of clothes, variations
	in speed and footwear on the recognition performance. We have demonstrated
	that clothing drastically affects performance regardless of elapsed
	time and significantly more than any of the other covariates that
	we have considered here. The research then suggests a move towards
	developing appearance invariant recognition algorithms.}
