This paper aims at analysing threat of replay attacks when using large speaker databases and most effective speaker verification systems, and compare it with the threat of other spoofing algorithms: voice conversion and speech synthesis. The impact of acoustic environment and playback devices on performance of speaker verification systems will be also investigated. 

This work will also verify the effectiveness of replay detection, using two previously described replay countermeasures: 
\begin{itemize}
\item the far-field detector (from here on in referred to as FFD) described in~\cite{Villalba2011}, which had been shown to be effective in detecting far-field recordings, and 
\item the local binary patterns-based detector (from here on in referred to as LBP), described in~\cite{Alegre2013a}, which yielded satisfactory results for a variety of attacks (artificial signals, speech synthesis and voice conversion).
\end{itemize}
Therefore, we are going to identify a relative threat of replay using the state-of-the-art ASV systems and two replay countermeasures.
