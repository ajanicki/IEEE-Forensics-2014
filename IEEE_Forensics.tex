% Note that the a4paper option is mainly intended so that authors in
% countries using A4 can easily print to A4 and see how their papers will
% look in print - the typesetting of the document will not typically be
% affected with changes in paper size (but the bottom and side margins will).
% Use the testflow package mentioned above to verify correct handling of
% both paper sizes by the user's LaTeX system.
%
% Also note that the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", option
% should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be displayed in
% draft mode.

% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)

\usepackage{graphicx}

\usepackage{multirow}



% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are

  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no

  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics

\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at:

% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:

%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.

% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/






% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***

% "AB" then you have to do: "\textbf{A}\textbf{B}"
% \thanks is no different in this regard, so shield the last } of each \thanks
% that ends a line with a % and do not let a space in before the next \thanks.
% Spaces after \IEEEmembership other than the last one are OK (and needed) as

\begin{abstract}
This article analyses the threat of replay spoofing or presentation attacks in 
the context of automatic speaker verification (ASV).  
%Replay may present a significant threat to their reliability.  i
As relatively high-technology attacks, speech synthesis and voice conversion, which have thus far received far greater attention in the literature, are probably beyond the means of the average fraudster.  The implementation of replay attacks, in contrast, requires no specific expertise nor sophisticated equipment.  Replay attacks are thus likely to be the most prolific in practice, even if their impact is relatively under-researched.  This paper compares the threat of replay attacks to those of speech synthesis and voice conversion.  The comparison is performed using strictly controlled protocols and with six different ASV systems including a state-of-the-art iVector system with probabilistic linear discriminant analysis.  %While comparatively higher-effort spoofing attacks have received far greater attention in the recent past, 
Experiments show that low-effort replay attacks present at least a comparable threat to speech synthesis and voice conversion.  %Perhaps surprisingly, score normalisation is shown to increase the vulnerability of ASV to replay attacks.%
The paper also describes and assesses two replay attack countermeasures.  A relatively new approach based on the local binary pattern (LBP) analysis of speech spectrograms is shown to outperform a competing approach based on the detection of far-field recordings.

\section{Experimental setup}
\label{sec::evaluation}

The comparison of replay, speech synthesis and voice conversion spoofing attacks necessitates controlled experiments with a large, standard corpus, a variety of ASV systems and judicious experimental protocols.  They are described here.


\subsection{Methodology}
\label{subsec::evaluation::methodology}

%{\bfseries We need to say something about the noise - I presume that, since the only noise added is convolutive, there is no additive noise???  We need to be sure that the degradations in performance aren't just because the speech is more noisy.} [AJ] No, there is no additive noise. Where do you think we should mention this?

% 
% If you have an EPS/PDF photo (graphicx package needed) extra braces are
% needed around the contents of the optional argument to biography to prevent
% the LaTeX parser from getting confused when it sees the complicated
% \includegraphics command within an optional argument. (You could create
% your own custom macro containing the \includegraphics command to make things
% simpler here.)
%\begin{IEEEbiography}[{\includegraphics[width=1in,height=1.25in,clip,keepaspectratio]{mshell}}]{Michael Shell}
% or if you just want to reserve a space for a photo:


% I think there is a 10-page limit to first submission so I removed the bios.


% if you will not have a photo at all:
%\begin{IEEEbiographynophoto}{Artur Janicki}
%Biography text here.
%\end{IEEEbiographynophoto}

% insert where needed to balance the two columns on the last page with
% biographies

% You can push biographies down or up by placing
% a \vfill before or after them. The appropriate
% use of \vfill depends on what kind of text is
% on the last page and whether or not the columns
% are being equalized.
