Due to lack of real replay recordings (e.g., similar to the MOBIO corpus collected in real environment~\cite{Khoury2013a}) we had to use artificial setup of replay environment, however, using impulse responses calculated using real playback hardware and real acoustic environments. 

This work will also verify the effectiveness of replay detection, using two previously described replay countermeasures: 

Case for emulated attacks - there is no alternative.  Similar to what has been done for all other work.

In the following we describe the ASV systems used in this study, the datasets, protocols and metrics, and then the implementation of replay emulation and implementation of the countermeasures.
