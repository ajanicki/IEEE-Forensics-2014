Due to lack of real replay recordings (e.g., similar to the MOBIO corpus collected in real environment~\cite{Khoury2013a}) we had to use artificial setup of replay environment, however, using impulse responses calculated using real playback hardware and real acoustic environments. 

This work will also verify the effectiveness of replay detection, using two previously described replay countermeasures: 


\begin{itemize}
\item the far-field detector (from here on in referred to as FFD) described in~\cite{Villalba2011}, which had been shown to be effective in detecting far-field recordings, and 
\item the local binary patterns-based detector (from here on in referred to as LBP), described in~\cite{Alegre2013a}, which yielded satisfactory results for a variety of attacks (artificial signals, speech synthesis and voice conversion).
\end{itemize}


Therefore, we are going to identify a relative threat of replay using the state-of-the-art ASV systems and two replay countermeasures.


In the following we describe the ASV systems used in this study, the datasets, protocols and metrics, and then the implementation of replay emulation and implementation of the countermeasures.
